# Py-IDS
An intrusion detection system made with python.

To run enter:
sudo python3 start.py 
and provide the network-interface of your choice.

I made this intrusion detection system to get an understanding of how attacks are launched and detected. I am not claiming 
that this is an original but I feel re-inventing the wheel is a great exercise.
